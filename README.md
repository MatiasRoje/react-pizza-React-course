Pizza restaurant delivery project from the course 'The Ultimate React Course 2023: React, Redux & More' on Udemy by Jonas Schmedtmann.

The project was originally programmed entirely in JavaScript, but I coded along and did it in TypeScript for learning purposes.

It's not deployed as it's not deemed necessary, but that could change in the future.
